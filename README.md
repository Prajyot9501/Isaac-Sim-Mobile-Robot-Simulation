# ü§ñ Simulating a Mobile Robot in Isaac Sim 
A hands-on robotics simulation project using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2, designed to explore, build, and control intelligent robots in a virtual environment. 
This readme includes details about the building, configuring, controlling and accessing data in simulated environment. It is perfect way for you to learn Isaac sim. It all starts with building a mobile robot with chasis, wheel and joints and goes till involving ROS2 bridge to access data from sensors in Rviz.
